SortingAlgorithmAnimations
==========================


This is a simple fork that has been stripped down and modified from:
https://github.com/vbohush/SortingAlgorithmAnimations

The program has been modified to focus on 3 specific sorting algorithms:
- selection sort
- merge sort
- bubble sort

A timer has also been added to better benchmark the algorithms against eachother.
